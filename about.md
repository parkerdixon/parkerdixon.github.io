### More about me

I am a former Financial Risk Consultant and current Data Scientist with a passion for using quantitative methods to explore data. I grew up in New Jersey and attended Vanderbilt University, where I studied Mathematics and finance.

I've played tennis, golf, and basketball for most of my life, and recently developed a passion for squash as well. I'm an avid New York sports fan (Knicks, Giants, Devils, Yankees) and a passionate Georgia Bulldogs fan (blame my dad).

As I begin my data science career, I hope to find a job focusing on using quantitative analytics to solve problems, ideally in either finance or sports. Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions about my posts or if you just want to chat about data science. Thanks for visiting!
